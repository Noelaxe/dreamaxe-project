                I am Noel S. George, from Trivandrum, Kerala, currently doing an Integrated Masters course at NIT Warangal. I am interested in a lot of things so I thought of making this newspaper style website to document everything for myself.             </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Iâ€™ll try not to use any AI in the making of this website as I see a certain kind of beauty in things made from scratch, even though they may not look the best. I plan to add pages to this place as time goes own, and document my own life in these lines of html and css (and more as I learn more of web development), hoping to create something remarkable to look back on.             </p>

                My very own blog page, as I find other blog posting sites a hassle since most of the needed features are behind paywalls. I do not think I can post very frequently, but I have to start somewhere. I will post essays that go on in my head, that I can't find anyone else to share it with, but which should be written down somewhere nonetheless.

                A place to keep all the important sites I find in case I need it later on. I will add pdfs and guides as well that I find important so that I can access them easily later on. It should become my personal handbook of treasures as time goes on.

                My daily log journal but mostly a way to keep myself accountable. I will write whatever I have done that day just to convince myself that I am making progress and also to convince myself to be productive throughout the day. I hope the friction to write something is not too much to keep up with this.
